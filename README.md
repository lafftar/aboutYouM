# aboutYouM

- Found a domain on the aboutyou network that let you grab all the pids in a whole store/region (millions of json objects with product data in one go), bypass got patched like a day after i posted it on sneakerdev discord tho ðŸ˜‚. 
- Look in base_classes/pid_grabber.py.
- Also left some recon notes in there.
